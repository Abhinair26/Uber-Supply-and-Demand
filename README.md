Here’s a clear and professional **project description** for your Uber request data analysis project:

---

### 🚖 **Uber Request Data Analysis Project**

#### 📌 **Project Objective:**

The goal of this project is to analyze Uber cab request data to identify patterns and uncover insights related to supply-demand gaps, peak request hours, and driver availability. The final outcome is to provide actionable insights that can help Uber optimize its operations and reduce customer cancellations and unfulfilled ride requests.

---

#### 📂 **Dataset Description:**

The dataset contains records of Uber ride requests with the following key columns:

* **Request id**: Unique ID of the ride request.
* **Pickup point**: Either the airport or city.
* **Driver id**: Unique ID of the driver (missing if no driver was assigned).
* **Status**: Status of the request (`Trip Completed`, `Cancelled`, or `No Cars Available`).
* **Request timestamp** and **Drop timestamp**: Time at which the ride was requested and completed.

---

#### 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies Used:**

* **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and creating the dashboard.
* **Python (Pandas & Matplotlib/Seaborn)**: For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* **SQL**: For deriving deeper insights using queries.
* **PowerPoint**: For presenting key findings and recommendations.

#### 📊 **Key Analysis Performed:**

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Parsed inconsistent date-time formats.
   * Handled missing values and null driver IDs.
   * Extracted features such as hour, day, and time slots.

2. **EDA Insights** (Python):

   * Peak demand hours during morning (5–10 AM) and evening (5–9 PM).
   * Majority of morning requests are from city to airport with a high cancellation rate.
   * Evening requests are mostly from airport to city with many “No Cars Available” statuses.

3. **SQL Insights**:

   * Hour-wise ride status distribution.
   * Percentage of requests completed vs. failed.
   * Pickup point-specific issues (e.g., more cancellations in the city).

4. **Excel Dashboard**:

   * Interactive visuals to filter request status by time slot and location.
   * Charts showing the demand-supply gap.
   * Summary KPIs on total requests, completion rate, and failure reasons.

---

#### ✅ **Business Recommendations:**

* **Morning Slot**: Address driver cancellations from city pickups with incentives or penalties.
* **Evening Slot**: Increase driver availability near the airport during peak hours.
* **General**: Improve driver allocation algorithm and add predictive alerts for high-demand times.
