        "   * A majority of trip cancellations occur at the **City** pickup point, while most **No Cars Available** issues arise at the **Airport**.\n",

        "\n",
        "   * Peak demand is seen during **early morning and evening hours**, aligning with common office commute times.\n",
        "   * **Driver availability doesn't match rider demand** during these hours, resulting in high cancellation and unavailability rates.\n",

        "   * The **Morning Rush** and **Evening Rush** time slots experience the highest number of requests but also the highest failure rates.\n",
